# MyFridge
<!--ABOUT THE PROJECT-->
MyFridge is a personal project to reduce food waste by reminding the user when the groceries in the fridge reach their expiration date. 

Users will receive email-notificatios listing the groceries which will expire soon. Usesr can add food to their personal fridge and keep track of what they already have at home when shopping for groceries. Additionally, users can add their personal recipes and create meal plans and shopping lists which will look into their fridge and see what they already have at home.
